Code to use and understand variance partitioning analyses.

For an example of how to run a variance partitioning analysis using the functions I've written, see VP_example.py.
For an example where I found negative unique variance in some of my data, see VP_NegativeUniqueVariance.py.
For simulations where I found some cases of negative shared variance, see VP_NegativeSharedVariance.py.
